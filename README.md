# Arbitrage Opportunity Detector

## Project Overview
This application is designed to uncover real-time arbitrage opportunities in the foreign exchange market. It scrutinizes variances in currency exchange rates across multiple brokers, employing a mathematical model for triangular arbitrage detection. The backend is developed in C++, integrated with a REST API to acquire real-time currency data. The frontend is built using React to visually represent the arbitrage opportunities, enhancing user interaction and understanding of potential financial outcomes.
